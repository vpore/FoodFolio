# FoodFolio
- A Web App that helps in reducing food wastage by notifying about food items that have their expiry date approaching.
- Used Nodemailer and cron job to send automated reminder email notifications 10 days prior to the expiry date of the food item.
- Implemented Spoonacular API to recommend recipes that can be prepared using only the existing food items in the
kitchen.
